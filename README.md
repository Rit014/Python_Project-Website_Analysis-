# Python_Project-Website_Analysis-
This project performs website data analysis using powerful Python libraries for data manipulation, numerical analysis, and visualization â€” including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. It is designed to process structured data collected from websites (e.g., crawl results, SEO metrics, traffic data, etc.) and generate insightful analytics and visual reports.
Technologies Used
Library	Purpose
pandas	Data manipulation and cleaning
numpy	Numerical computations
seaborn	Statistical data visualization
matplotlib	Plotting and figure customization

Example Use Cases
Analyzing exported Google Analytics or Search Console data
Comparing SEO performance across pages
Visualizing website crawl data (e.g., word counts, load time)
Creating monthly traffic reports or dashboards

Features
